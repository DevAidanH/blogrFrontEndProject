# Blogr Design Challenge  

This was a project created in standard HTML and CSS as part of a Frontend design challenge. It was fun to cod eup while my students were working. It uses some fun hover effects and the moblie layout wass very challenging. It was fun to do something arty again as my last few projects have been very "Code" heavy.
